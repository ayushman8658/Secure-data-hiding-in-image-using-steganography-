# Secure-data-hiding-in-image-using-steganography-
This project implements image steganography, a technique for securely hiding sensitive data within images. Unlike traditional encryption, which may attract attention, steganography ensures covert communication by embedding information in a way that is visually undetectable.ðŸ”§ Technologies : Python Libraries: OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy, Cryptography
